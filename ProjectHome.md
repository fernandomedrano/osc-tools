# Tools: #
## OSC (Open Sound Control) Data monitor ##
Monitor incoming OSC data on your computer. Quick check if you have communication with OSC sending equipment in your network.  See http://www.kasperkamperman.com/blog/osc-datamonitor/ for a video walkthrough.

## Scratch OSC bridge ##
Send and receive OSC data to and from [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu). You can interface Scratch with external sensors and OSC sending applications/apps.

You can also use Scratch to send OSC data to control audio software, VJ software or creative applications.

[Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu) is the ideal tool for rapid prototyping idea's.

If you created work with Scratch OSC bridge, please let me know.
