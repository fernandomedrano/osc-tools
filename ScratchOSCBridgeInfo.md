# Introduction #

With the Scratch OSC bridge Scratch can communicate with OSC sending and receiving applications.

The bridge converts OSC messages to Scratch sensor and broadcast messages. More technical information about this you'll find at:

# Scratch example projects #

All the Scratch projects are commented, so open and discover.

**Scratch TUIO**

Move the Scratch cat with a TUIO client.

Good TUIO trackers:
  * [tuioDroid (tracker for Android)](http://market.android.com/details?id=tuioDroid.impl)
  * [tuioPad (tracker for iOS devices](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tuiopad/id412446962)
  * [tongseng (use trackpad as tuio tracker)](http://github.com/fajran/tongseng)

More TUIO tracker implementations at [tuio.org](http://www.tuio.org/?software)

**Scratch TouchOSC**

Move the Scratch cat with TouchOSC.

Use the acceleration sensor data to move the cat.
Change the color with fader5 and change the background with different layouts.
